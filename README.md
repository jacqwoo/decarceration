Analysis of longitudinal census and Uniform Crime Report data in Texas to assess the effect of a reform prosecutor on crime, using differences-in-differences analysis
Note: This analysis aims to examine the impact of elected a reform-minded DA, Craig Watkins, in Dallas County, TX, on serious crim. Watkins is one of the first "reform-minded" DAs elected in the US, which translates a larger dataset to work with. In the case of my analysis, was matching and differences-in-differences, this enabled a longer post period. There is a big caveat to this analysis. The influence of DAs lies mostly in the judicial branch and I was not able to identify specific policies or procedures that would plausibly reduce serious crime. This hinders the internal validity of this analysis. I still think this is an interesting question that will hopefully generate more answers with more time and data.
